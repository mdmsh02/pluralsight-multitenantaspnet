This gives us a common model for analyzing performance data, like TPS. We open sourced some of this work into a library called CacheSharp (on Github and NuGet).

The shared Windows and Windows Phone Runtime solves this question with a simple app lifecycle that suspends unused apps.

But, as a developer, what if you need to execute code even when your app is suspended or not running? Introducing the Background Task, a core part of the Windows Runtime framework. Background Tasks can update your live tile, geofence, synchronize data, or do whatever your apps needs to do in order to create value.

Over the last decade, I’ve worked with companies ranging from software, financials, to media and entertainment. Solving scale problems with leading innovations in the tech space has been an area of interest to me. From building APIs at E*Trade, IGN, and Netflix I’ve evolved both as a leader as well as an engineer focused on scalable yet flexible, and highly performant architectures.\n\nCurrently I am working at Netflix as an Engineering Manager in the Streaming Platforms group, where my team builds APIs and tools around device data and partner products. Prior to Netflix I was Director of Engineering at IGN.com, where I helped build the next-gen API for the social and content platforms.\n\nFollow me @lobster1234 on Twitter, and linkedin.com/in/mpandit on LinkedIn",

Before I joined Microsoft in 2011, I was active in the local open source community.  I discovered functional programming through Scala, which I enjoyed very much.  At a Silicon Valley Code Camp in 2008, I had a break in my schedule and decided to attend a talk on F# by Tim Ng of Microsoft.  At that time, I didn't even own a Windows computer and had only heard faint whispers about F#.  By the end of Tim's talk, I was sold.  F# really clicked with me.  I stopped what I was doing, switched my home machine from Solaris to Windows, and dove into F# and .NET.  I soon learned that to really become an expert in .NET, you have to know C#, which I then picked up and enjoyed just as much.  I tossed VB.NET in for good measure.  After joining Microsoft, I expanded on the C++ skills I used in my interest in scientific computing.",

Before I joined Microsoft in 2011, I was active in the local open source community.  I discovered functional programming through Scala, which I enjoyed very much.  At a Silicon Valley Code Camp in 2008, I had a break in my schedule and decided to attend a talk on F# by Tim Ng of Microsoft.  At that time, I didn't even own a Windows computer and had only heard faint whispers about F#.  By the end of Tim's talk, I was sold.  F# really clicked with me.  I stopped what I was doing, switched my home machine from Solaris to Windows, and dove into F# and .NET.  I soon learned that to really become an expert in .NET, you have to know C#, which I then picked up and enjoyed just as much.  I tossed VB.NET in for good measure.  After joining Microsoft, I expanded on the C++ skills I used in my interest in scientific computing.",

You have to worry about resources, collections of resources, pagination, query parameters, references to other resources, which HTTP Methods to use, HTTP Caching, security, and more!

Further, while there are many references on creating REST APIs with XML, there are much fewer references for REST + JSON.\n\nIn this presentation, Les Hazlewood - Stormpath CTO and Apache Shiro PMC Chair - will share all of the golden nuggets learned while designing, implementing and supporting JSON-based REST APIs, using examples from a clean real-world REST+JSON API.  He will cover:\n\n* JSON-based data formats in a RESTful API\n* References to other JSON-based resources (aka 'linking').\n* Resource collections and pagination\n* How to map (and how not to map) HTTP methods to Resource CRUD\n* Resource partial updates\n* Supporting HTTP Method Overloading for clients that don't support HTTP PUT and DELETE\n* API versioning strategies\n* Meaningful Error responses\n* Many-to-many resource relationships\n* HTTP Caching and Optimistic concurrency control.\n* Authentication and Security\n",

GameMaker Studio is also advanced enough for seasoned game developers to build games for desktops, web (HTML5),  and Android & iOS mobile devices.\n\nIn this hands-on tutorial, you will be introduced to GameMaker Studio drag and drop functionality to build an arcade game, with brief exposure to scripting.  In the process, you will learn how to create a \"game plan\", identifying the game assets and objects, and designing behaviors and interactions.  I will also mention the advantages of GameMaker over other game development environments such as Stencyl,  GameSalad, Construct 2, and Unity.\n\nIf you'd like to do the exercise, please  bring a Windows laptop or a Mac with Windows on a Virtual Machine or Bootcamp.

            "sessionsMaterialUrl": "",
            "description": "<p>A common misconception about agile is that managers are unnecessary. After all, agile is based on self-organizing teams. If the teams organize themselves, what do managers do? </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, most scrum training plays into that. Think about it: how many trainers or coaches have you seen sketch the structure of a scrum team with a drawing that includes a manager?

Video games are extremely popular on smart phones and tablets. While the odds are against your game becoming a smash hit, is still possible to make a fun game which generates a bit of money via direct sales or in-game advertising. \n\nIn this three part session we will explore using Cocos2d-x, an open source game engine, to build games for all three major smart phone platforms - Android, Apple, and Microsoft. Unlike other game engines, Cocos2d-x is not only free, it runs on multiple platforms giving you the ability to port your game not only to the most popular phone platforms but to desktop platforms like Windows and Mac OS X.\n",

With so many database-driven projects for consumer desktop software applications, websites and enterprise software systems, the database design plays a crucial role in the success of your project. You'll see real-life examples and issues such as: Creating a new table; Choosing data types; Normalization (and when to denormalize); Types of relationships; Referential integrity; Join/relationship tables; 1-to-many, many-to-many; How to actually use these structures in your application; While the examples will focus on SQL Server, the techniques and SQL code will work for virtually any SQL database.

RTI Data Distribution Service (DDS) will be used as the source of data and as a communication channel for asynchronous data streams. On top of DDS, we'll use Rx to subscribe, observe, project, filter, aggregate, merge, zip, and correlate one or more data streams (Observables). The live demo will be very visual as bouncing shapes of different colors will be transformed in front of you using C# lambdas, Rx.NET, and LinqPad. You will also learn about the new Rx4DDS.NET library that integrates RTI DDS with Rx.NET. Rx and DDS are a great match because both are reactive. Rx is based on the subject-observer pattern, which is quite analogous to the publish-subscribe pattern of DDS. When used together they support distributed dataflows seamlessly. If time permits, we will touch upon advanced Rx concepts such as stream of streams (IGroupedObservable) and how it captures DDS \"keyed topics\". The DDS applications using Rx4DDS.NET dramatically simplify concurrency to the extent that it can be simply configured. Sounds too good to be true? Listen to the talk and watch the demo.",

After seven years of working on JIRA, Stash and other developer tools out of Atlassian's Australian office, he made the move to San Francisco. Today, Tim's official job title is Developer Provocateur. \n \nTim thinks that all software, but particularly developer tools, should be built with extensibility in mind. He splits his days between building tools and platform APIs for Atlassian's developer ecosystem and blogging or speaking about developer tools, API design and building hackable products. \n \nTim also claims the first commit to Stash, Atlassian's enterprise Git repository management tool. His time on Stash taught him more about Git than is probably healthy, and he enjoys regularly speaking and blogging about Git arcanery.\n \nBeyond his day job, Tim enjoys hacking on Android games and 3D graphics. His current pet project is a libgdx-powered arcade-style shooter that he hopes to release to critical acclaim later this year (although this is the 3rd year he's said that).",

After seven years of working on JIRA, Stash and other developer tools out of Atlassian's Australian office, he made the move to San Francisco. Today, Tim's official job title is Developer Provocateur. \n \nTim thinks that all software, but particularly developer tools, should be built with extensibility in mind. He splits his days between building tools and platform APIs for Atlassian's developer ecosystem and blogging or speaking about developer tools, API design and building hackable products. \n \nTim also claims the first commit to Stash, Atlassian's enterprise Git repository management tool. His time on Stash taught him more about Git than is probably healthy, and he enjoys regularly speaking and blogging about Git arcanery.\n \nBeyond his day job, Tim enjoys hacking on Android games and 3D graphics. His current pet project is a libgdx-powered arcade-style shooter that he hopes to release to critical acclaim later this year (although this is the 3rd year he's said that).",

I've made plugins that make zombies poisonous and turn the air into a toxic fume, driving players underground. One plugin I wrote wore away the earth wherever players walked. Another charged in-game money for every command and action a player took. For me, Minecraft is a powerful tool for exploring computer science, art, and social interaction.",

First we will explore the fashion industry, as a system for producing and distributing clothing and accessories.  Then the speaker will cover aspects of modernization & globalization including eco-innovation, crowdsourcing and pre-tailing. This section will end by offering “insider hints” highlighting how to collaborate with a fashion company.\n\nSecond we will cover advanced technologies used to build wearable fashion with an overview of MEMS (motion, position, environmental and capture) sensors and wireless (NFC, Bluetooth 4.0) connectivity used to build wearable fashion with code samples (iOS & Android) capturing physiological data. We will review of the current wearable market (eg. Nike Fuelband, Shine, Lark, Fitbit, Bodybug & Google - Glass / Moto / Ara).  This section will provide a real world example of placing Bluetooth 4.0 connected MEMS devices into a shoe which will lead to some surprising capabilities (telling us how to exercise properly).  This section will conclude by exploring this final thought.   “If it looks amazing and does not work well people will forgive but if it works great and it is ugly, no one will wear it.”\n\nThe talk will culminate by showing how these two industries will co-evolve and the different forms these collaborations can take. Their growth will now come from radically new products that combine the best that these two industries can offer. \n",

Then the speaker will cover aspects of modernization & globalization including eco-innovation, crowdsourcing and pre-tailing. This section will end by offering “insider hints” highlighting how to collaborate with a fashion company.\n\nSecond we will cover advanced technologies used to build wearable fashion with an overview of MEMS (motion, position, environmental and capture) sensors and wireless (NFC, Bluetooth 4.0) connectivity used to build wearable fashion with code samples (iOS & Android) capturing physiological data. We will review of the current wearable market (eg. Nike Fuelband, Shine, Lark, Fitbit, Bodybug & Google - Glass / Moto / Ara).  This section will provide a real world example of placing Bluetooth 4.0 connected MEMS devices into a shoe which will lead to some surprising capabilities (telling us how to exercise properly).  This section will conclude by exploring this final thought.   “If it looks amazing and does not work well people will forgive but if it works great and it is ugly, no one will wear it.”\n\nThe talk will culminate by showing how these two industries will co-evolve and the different forms these collaborations can take. Their growth will now come from radically new products that combine the best that these two industries can offer. \n",

Accurately calculate out how long you have to infect the villagers before you decompose using Durations.  And coordinate global attacks on the humans by syncing with your undead brethren on Instants.  With the power of Java 8, eradicating the human race with a highly infectious virus has never been easier!\n\nThis presentation is designed to teach Java Date and Time APIs to the undead, but the living are welcome to be our \"guests\".  You may also learn some JavaFX in the process -- that is entirely my fault.  Any correlation between the characters and events in this presentation and the impending extinction of mankind is purely coincidental.",
